## Olympic Data Analysis using SQL

The project is based on the Olympic Games dataset. The dataset contains information about the athletes, countries, events, and medals won in the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2012. The dataset is available in the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) website.

This project has some 20 SQL Queries wherein different concepts of SQL are used to answer the questions. The questions are based on the dataset and are related to the Olympics. The questions are as follows:

1. Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?
2. Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?
3.  Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count?

and so on.

It utilizes the concepts of SQL such as Joins, Subqueries, Aggregations, and Window Functions.
